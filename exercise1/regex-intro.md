# Introduction to Regular Expressions

## Exercise 1: What is Regex?

Regular expressions, or regex, are any series of characters that allow programmers to specify a search pattern in a string of text. In JavaScript, and other programming languages, we can use regex to match patterns, create filters, and find and replace substrings within a block of text.

In real world applications, regex is everywhere! Have you ever created a new user account, and needed to pass some series of checks (ie: one letter, one number, and a special character) before your password could be accepted? Perhaps you’ve tried signing up for a mailing list, but forgot to include the “@” symbol, and received a warning to provide a valid email address. Or maybe, you’ve gone to make a purchase online, and received an error after incorrectly entering your credit card number.

In all of these scenarios, the likelihood is high that regex has been implemented to perform the logic behind all of these validations. Indeed, regex is an incredibly powerful tool. With its robust capabilities, it can sometimes look like a language of its own. Constructing more detailed sequences of regex can quickly complicated, and in general it can take time to master. In this lesson, we'll take things slow and learn the fundamentals of regular expressions, so that we can build upon this foundation in future lessons.
