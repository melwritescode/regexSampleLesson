### Topic

For my sample lesson I chose to build a curriculum on regular expressions (regex) in JavaScript. The planning process was very involved as regex is a complex and intricate concept to master.  

I decided that building an introductory lesson would allow me to incorporate the greatest range of topics in my lesson, while still making it approachable for the emerging developer. I considered several different subtopics to include, ultimately deciding on: simple pattern matching, quantifiers, character sets, and metacharacters. 

These topics seemed to cover the most essential features of regex, and together offer a great deal of flexibility and power in building robust search patterns. In each lesson I made an effort to combine concepts from previous units so that each set of challenges would build on knowledge gained in past exercises. 

I considered including capture groups, but for the sake of simplicity chose not to include them. I wanted to include syntax that felt intuitive and immediately practical. From my experience with regular expressions, capture groups are most useful when constructing more detailed search patterns. 

I also considered positive and negative lookaheads, groups, and search and replace, but chose not too include these subjects since they are much more advanced. In my personal experience, I have rarely, if ever, used any of these features, and felt that in an introductory lesson it would confuse learners and ultimately create more frustration then serve any benefit.

### Style

My writing style shares a lot of similarity with Codecademy's. First, like many of Codecademy's lessons, my lesson starts with a general introduction to the concept, before getting into specific examples. Each of my exercises includes a narrative about the given topic that discusses what will be covered and why it is relevant. Additionally, for each topic covered, I make sure to draw connections to real world applications of the concept. 

Another similarity between my curriculum style and Codecademy's is the use of code blocks to provide examples of the current subject. Each time I introduce a new subtopic I include at least one relevant example demonstrating the use of the syntax. Finally, much like Codecademy, I prefer a relaxed, casual writing style in an effort to make the material feel more approachable. 

The biggest difference between my style and Codecademy's is that I like to make all of the exercises in a lesson accessible, whether a user has completed the previous exercises or not. In contrast, Codecademy makes exercises inaccessible until the user has completed all exercises that lead up to it. I prefer to give the user full autonomy over their learning and the ability to decide if they want to jump ahead, while leaving them the option to backtrack to earlier exercises if need be.  

Another difference in our respective styles is that each of the challenges in an exercise on Codecademy seem to center around a theme, and each subsequent challenge builds upon the previous challenge. My style differs in that some of the challenges follow this pattern, while in other exercises each challenge is independent of the others. I like both styles and feel that each has it's  benefits and shortcomings. 

Finally, I notice some differences in the way my lessons are formatted compared to Codecademy's. Specifically Codecademy's exercises seem to make great use of bullet points and numbered lists to break down concepts, while all of my content is written in blocks of text. Again, I think both styles have their advantages and disadvantages. I am interested in making my writing style more flexible to incorporate these nuances where appropriate.

### Feedback

I am very motivated to grow as a curriculum writer. An area that I would seek feedback is the formatting of my lesson. Specifically, I am interested in ways to make it more visually parseable and easy to read, as well as styling options to make it more engaging for the learner. 

I would also love to receive feedback on the challenges I've provided. I'd love to get thoughts on whether or not my exercises are appropriate for the intended audience, if they adequately cover the scope of the material, and how well they assess a comprehensive mastery of topics reviewed.

Finally, I'd appreciate feedback on the content itself. Is my writing style engaging for users of multiple backgrounds? Does it convey the real world practicality of the material discussed? Is the language simple and easy to understand?

I am grateful for the opportunity to work on this assignment, and would sincerely appreciate any feedback and the opportunity to improve on that materials I have provided. Thank you.
